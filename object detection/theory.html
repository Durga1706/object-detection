## What is Object Detection
Object Detection is a computer vision technique for locating image in an image or a video. It gives us the bounding box information
(x,y,width,height) of the object as well as classification of the object(car).

## Object Classification vs Object Detection vs Object Segmentation
OC identifies what type of object is present in an image (whether it is a cat or dog etc)
OD identifies and locate the presence of an object, it gives us the bounding box information and the class as well
OS separates the distinct objects in an image on a pixel level.

Although OS gives more information we prefer OD since it is less computationally expensive.
