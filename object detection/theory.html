## What is Object Detection
Object Detection is a computer vision technique for locating image in an image or a video. It gives us the bounding box information
(x,y,width,height) of the object as well as classification of the object(car).

## Object Classification vs Object Detection vs Object Segmentation
OC identifies what type of object is present in an image (whether it is a cat or dog etc)
OD identifies and locate the presence of an object, it gives us the bounding box information and the class as well
OS separates the distinct objects in an image on a pixel level.

Although OS gives more information we prefer OD since it is less computationally expensive.

## History
It was started in the 1970. First it was based on edges and corners. The first od was developed in Viola Jones in 2001 it used sliding windows.
Next we used it for face detection in smart phones and cameras. 
Histogram of oriented gradients was another method released in 2005 that focus on the shape of object it worked by extracting the gradient and orientation
of the edges was used to detect images in the images.
Then AI came up with neural network 

## Performence metrics
1. how good is the location and 2. how good is the classification
for localization we use IoU and mAP for classification.

IoU(Intersection Over Union):
It tells us how close the predicted bounding box to the original, it's a value between 0 and 1 if there is some overlap. If 1 it is then it is a perfect detection.
If there is no overlap it is 0. 
IoU is the ration between the area of intersection and area of the union of bounding boxes

Average Precision:
Precision: Actual positive of the tot positive predictions. TP/(TP+FP)
Recall: Actual positives out of all predictions. TP/(TP+FN)
Since both values provide valuable info we combine them and call Avergae precision.
ap for a single class and for multiple classes it is mean average precision(mAP).
